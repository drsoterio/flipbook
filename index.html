              This project presents a collaborative field guide documenting “digital ecologies of hope”: instances
              where media technologies become instruments of collective imagination, care, and becoming across diverse
              global contexts. Using the aesthetic and organizational principles of naturalist field guides, fourteen
              researchers contribute “specimens” from their work, ranging from Sudanese youth maintaining educational
              networks amid civil war to transgender youth documenting voice transitions as acts of collective
              becoming. Each specimen follows field guide conventions (i.e., classification, habitat, conservation
              status, field notes, and visual documentation), treating hopeful practices as living systems worthy of
              documentation and preservation. Ultimately, by attending to what we call “felt futures”—the emotionally
              charged visions of possibility that animate research—we seek to demonstrate how research itself can
              become utopian practice through collaborative authorship and multimodal representation.

            <p>Media studies finds itself responding to an accelerating cascade of technological crises—from surveillance capitalism and algorithmic <br/> bias to disinformation and democratic erosion—that understandably focuses scholarly attention on how digital systems amplify harm and concentrate power (Arora, 2024; Sebastián-Martín, 2024; Srnicek, 2017; Zuboff, 2019). In such moments, critical frameworks become essential tools for understanding these urgent threats. Yet this necessary hermeneutics of suspicion can obscure other dynamics within the same systems. Alongside exploitation and control, we continue to witness emergent practices of care, imagination, and collective becoming—practices that offer crucial insight into how people navigate technological constraints while opening up possibilities for different futures.</p>

            <p>Building on Rosner’s (2018) formulation of critical fabulations, this project attends to these hopeful practices without abandoning critique. By fabulation, we do not mean fabrication. Rather, following Rosner, we use the term to describe methods of reinterpreting and representing real-world practices in ways that surface alternative meanings, suppressed histories, and collective aspirations. Rosner writes of “telling stories that awaken alternative histories” and “shift according to the aspirations of those who absorb them” (p. 119). In extending Hartman’s (2008) concept of “writing against the archive,” she positions fabulation as a strategy of collective meaning-making that surfaces possibilities suppressed by dominant techno-narratives.</p>

            <p>Drawing inspiration from naturalist field guides—which serve as “invitation[s] not just to look, but to discover” (Rajendra-Nicolucci &amp; Zuckerman, 2021, p. 7)—our field guide enacts this strategy by weaving together rigorous observation, creative representation, and multimodal storytelling in ways that privilege care and imagination over academic convention. We do so by mapping these critical fabulations in an intentionally accessible, visual artifact, allowing them to take up their space in—and bridging the gap between—public and academic conversations around media. Our field guide also rises up to a critical challenge in contemporary utopias where, rather than only creating fictional maps of the future, there is a pressing need of producing “adequate maps of the present which permit images of a connected but transformed future” (Levitas, 1993, p. 257).</p>

            <p>Developed collaboratively within [anonymized lab name]—an international research collective exploring global intersections of media and social justice—this project brings together 14 researchers working across diverse cultural and methodological contexts. Each researcher contributes “specimens” from their work, representing instances where media practices foster agency, resilience, and collective imagination amid intersecting technological, social, political, and economic constraints. Reflecting our own backgrounds and sites of inquiry, these specimens span diverse contexts: Sudanese youth using social media to maintain educational communities amid civil war; Afro-Brazilian students finding identity affirmation through Instagram; transgender youth documenting voice transitions as acts of collective becoming; among others.</p>

            <p>The field guide format afforded us to carefully strike a fine balance between presenting difference and commonality—through identifying, classifying, and juxtaposing these diverse practices. With each entry authentically depicted and annotated with field notes, we embrace the nuances in each context. At the same time, we heed Fenton’s (2008, p. 245) advice of not showcasing hope as “disparate acts of resistance” and rather find a “binding solidarity” that is required to challenge the social and economic injustices on a global scale. We bind these practices and contexts in our field guide, offering a contemporary account on how utopia is collectively realized “into practical political realities” (Fenton, 2008, p. 244).</p>

            <p>Each specimen is documented using field guide conventions, including:</p>

            <p>As we have argued elsewhere, “doing research is not only a process of inquiry, data collection and analysis, but also an imaginative act that in itself is civic and political” (Authors, forthcoming). We are driven by a belief that researchers must attend to the affective and imaginative orientations embedded in scholarly work—what we term “felt futures,” the emotionally charged visions of possibility that animate research. Our field guide project embodies this understanding, treating the documentation of hopeful practices as itself a practice of imagination oriented toward different technological futures. Echoing Benjamin’s (2024) charge to dismantle dominant imaginaries and cultivate forms of imagination rooted in solidarity, we are treating hope not merely as an object of study but as a sustainable and equitable way of conducting research itself.</p>
            <p>Significantly, our approach also responds to what Arora (2024) identifies as the Western-centrism of techno-pessimism. Drawing on extensive fieldwork across the Global South, she notes that “pessimism is a privilege for those who can afford to live in despair. The rest of the world has little choice but to be optimistic as their future depends on it” (p. 15). Her critique underscores how dominant academic frameworks often marginalize the innovative and resilient ways in which people use technology to sustain community, create opportunity, and build change under precarious conditions perpetuated by systemic inequities. Keenly attuned to this critique, our specimens deliberately center perspectives often marginalized in dominant media studies discourse, particularly from the Global South and diasporic communities. </p>

            <p>Rather than defaulting to Western platforms or narratives, the practices we document span a range of sociotechnical environments—from conflict zones and diasporic classrooms to transnational activist networks—revealing how digital hope emerges within, and perhaps because of, conditions of constraint.</p>
            <p>Finally, this project embraces a collaborative model of knowledge production (Literat et al., 2017). Developing this project collaboratively, our approach mirrors the very practices we document: networks of care, collective meaning-making, and distributed agency. Just as our specimens reveal how digital media enables new forms of collective becoming, our authorship model exemplifies how academic knowledge production might “become otherwise” through more collaborative, inclusive, and equitable structures.</p>

            <p>Echoing Jackson’s (2023) argument that “the patient nurturing and mutual transmission of hope” is the central task of critical scholarship today, we see hope as both a methodological and epistemological stance: slow, collective, and deliberate. It is not a refusal to see constraints, but a commitment to nurturing possibilities within them.</p>
            <p>This field guide contributes to utopian media studies by showing how documentation and preservation can re-orient research toward affirmative, future-making commitments. We foreground how people improvise, adapt, and imagine otherwise—often from the margins of visibility—and offer tools for recognizing, sustaining, and joining these practices as they evolve with shifting conditions.</p>
